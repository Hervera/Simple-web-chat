# Simple Web Chat 

## How it works

1. Before entering the chat, You are prompted to enter your name, which is further used to identify your messages.
2. Messages are saved in memory (on the local machine, in localstorage).
3. Each new browser tab is a new chat user. Each new browser tab is a new chat user. The new messages in the chat room are updated to all opened tabs (live updating for all users). Doesn't use socket.io all.
4. You can send messages to chat.
5. You can see message history, and load more messages when scroll chats to the top. (page size = 25)
6. Tests are added on features where they are needed
